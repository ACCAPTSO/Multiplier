        Does your calculator give a wrong answer because you mistyped something?
        <br>Does it lie to you for some unknown reason?
        <p>It's easier to tell than you think! 
        </p>
        <p>Estimate an upper and lower range for your answer.
        <br>Does your answer have the right number of digits? 
        <br>Is the decimal point is in the right place? 
        <br>Is the least significant digit correct?
        <br>Is the most significant digit correct? 
        <br>Is the answer positive or negative?
        </p>
        
        <p>In this exercise you will be given an arithmetic problem and four
        statements about that problem. 
        <br>One or two of the statements are true.
        </p>
        <p>
        For each of the four statements, select "True" or "Possible" or leave "False",  then click "Check"
        </p>
        <p>Click "Next Problem" to continue</p>
