Original version will generate random 3 digit numbers to multiply by random
2 digit numbers. As the user select entry boxes and enters digits for intermediate
answers and carries in the boxes, the program will check them and display them in
red if they are incorrect.

Improved version will generate numbers with 2-5 digits and all the boxes needed
for intermediate answers. Will give hints by filling in a digit for the user if
he/she gives up and track missed guesses and hints needed. Entry boxes will be
automatically selected, although the user can override the selection, for example
to not bother writing down the carry or a 0.
